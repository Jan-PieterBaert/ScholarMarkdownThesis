This HTML-version of the thesis also has a PDF export available. It is possible
to generate one by printing this page and selecting "Save to PDF".  The
submitted version was generated in Firefox with a scale of 100 and margins of
0.78 inch. Set `print.save_as_pdf.internal_destinations.enabled` to `true` in
Firefox's `about:config` to make internal links to e.g. other sections work in
the PDF version.
Printing from Google Chrome gives an incorrect result, so the
submitted version is also available for direct download [here](/thesis.pdf).
