This PDF version of the thesis was generated from the original HTML version at
<https://example.com>{:.nobreak}. Some functions such as clickable
links might not be available in the PDF version due to limitations of the 
conversion from HTML to PDF.

This HTML-version of the thesis also has a PDF export available. It is possible
to generate one by printing this page and selecting "Save to PDF".  The
submitted version was generated in Firefox with a scale of 100 and margins of
0.78 inch. Set `print.save_as_pdf.internal_destinations.enabled` to `true` in
Firefox's `about:config` to make internal links to e.g. other sections work in
the PDF version. This might entirely break PDF generation though.
Printing from Google Chrome gives an incorrect result, so the
submitted version is also available for direct download [here](/thesis.pdf).
