# Literature Review

Looking around, there is a lot of literature...

Look at this code I found.

<figure id="lst:cool-code" class="listing">
<pre><code>#!python
def main():
    print(f"What is 1+1?")
    response = int(input())
    if response == "2":
        print("Wrong, it is 3")
    else:
        print("Wrong, it is 2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
<figcaption markdown="block">
I cannot get it right :'(
</figcaption>
</figure>
